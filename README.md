## Bugs Encountered
There were no major bugs only that the tokens had to be hidden and referenced correctly for them to function well after addition to .gitignore

## Technologies used

* CommandLine
* Ubuntu


## Installation
You may will need to install java version 11. The use of gradle will also come in handy. I otherwise needful, VScode maybe a preferred option in the absence of gradle.
